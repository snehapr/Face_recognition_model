# Face recogntion Model
1. The project is developed using python and related ML and DL libraries.
2. The Project is mainly used to recognise faces from the image/video.
3. I have used the Jurassic Park as the theme and have trained the model with set of known figure images from the movie Jurassic Park.
4. Then i have tested the model on the images as well as on videos....
5. Green bounding box along with the predicted name is shown around the face to tell whose face the model as recognised.
