# Face recogntion Model
1. The project is developed using python and related ML and DL libraries.
2. It is used to recognise faces from the given image/video.
3. I have used the "Jurassic Park" as the theme and have trained the model with set of known figure images from the movie Jurassic Park.
4. I have tested the model on both the input being images/vidoes and was able to achieve high accuracy in both the cases.
5. Green bounding box along with the predicted name is shown around the face to tell whose face the model as recognised.
